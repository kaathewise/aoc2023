# AOC 2023 Python one-liners

Python one-liners for https://adventofcode.com/2023. Some people object to calling them one-liners, as they are more like "single-expressions", but whatever.

See a similar repo for AOC 2022 [here](https://github.com/kaathewise/aoc2022).

The solution for each part should only consist of a single expression and, possibly, some import statements.

There are also a couple of ways to work around the single expression limitation, such as assignment expressions, tuples-as-control-flow, and eval'ing arbitrary code. While those are not restricted, the aim should only be to use them for readability, and not to abuse them.

Obviously, the code should be written by a human, not generated in any way.
