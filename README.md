# AOC 2023 Python one-liners

Python one-liners for https://adventofcode.com/2023.

See a similar repo for AOC 2022 [here](https://github.com/kaathewise/aoc2022).

The hard rule is simple: the solution should only consist of a single expression and, possibly, some import statements.

There are also a couple of ways to work around the single expression limitation, such as assignment expressions, tuples-as-control-flow, and `eval`'ing arbitrary code. While those are not restricted, the aim should only be to use them for readability, and not to abuse them.

Obviously, the code should be written by a human, not generated in any way.
